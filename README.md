# About this repository

This repository is the Chromium OS board overlay for the [Asus Tinkerboard single board computer](https://www.asus.com/us/Single-Board-Computer/Tinker-Board/).

The code and document in this repository is the result of works by the people of the FydeOS team. We previously worked on this overlay internally and released a few disk images to the public. Now we open this to the public so people can build the OS by themselves and improve it.


# How to build it

Please refer to the README in our [Chromium OS for Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/FydeOS/chromium_os_for_raspberry_pi) repo for how to setup and build Chromium OS.
